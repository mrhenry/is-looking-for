# Mr. Henry is looking for a fulltime developer

*At Mr. Henry, we sail against the current of the wild web development seas.*

Let aside the bad metaphors, we're working on our own way to build for the web. Instead of hopping on every new framework that pops up, we choose to take a step back and work on something stubborn & better.

Based on new, modern, and future-proof web standards, we're trying to build websites that work, everywhere, for everyone. For every *Shiny New Thing™*, we want to raise a thing that *Just Works™*.

If this tickles your curiosity, we'd like to talk to you.
If you think we're 100% in the wrong, we'd still like to talk to you.

## Who we are

Mr. Henry is an internet-bureau, graphic design firm, development lab, birthplace of concepts and ideas & creative cave... We love what we do! Mr. Henry is a small team, working on both little and big projects, be it on- or offline; but all with the same vigor!
