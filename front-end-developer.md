# Mr. Henry is looking for a front-end developer

*At Mr. Henry, we sail against the current of the wild web development seas.*

Let aside the bad metaphors, we're working on our own way to build for the web. Instead of hopping on every new framework that pops up, we choose to take a step back and work on something stubborn & better.

Based on new, modern and future-proof web standards, we're trying to build websites that work, everywhere, for everyone. For every *Shiny New Thing™*, we want to raise a thing that *Just Works™*.

If this really tickles your curiosity, we'd like to talk with you. If you think we're 100% in the wrong, we'd still like to talk with you.
